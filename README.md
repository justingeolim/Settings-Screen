# Q1 – Settings Screen

## Overview
A Settings screen built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3. The screen uses a scrollable Column as the main container, with each setting row implemented as a Row containing a label/description Column on the left and a control on the right. This is to demonstrate the utilization of different Material 3 components and modifiers.
